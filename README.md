# Overwatch-Random
A script to choose a character in Overwatch randomly.

A simple node script that will randomly choose a character to play in Blizzard's Overwatch game. 

Node will need to be installed on the computer. (http://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+to+install+Node)

Open the a command prompt and go to the directory where the script file is located. Then run the command "node RandomOverwatch.js"

I created this to improve my programming skills. I hope to expand upon this script and build an application that will not only do this, but also give suggestions on the best comps.
